// A traditional NativeScript application starts by initializing global objects, setting up global CSS rules, creating, and navigating to the main page.
// Angular applications need to take care of their own initialization: modules, components, directives, routes, DI providers.
// A NativeScript Angular app needs to make both paradigms work together, so we provide a wrapper platform object, platformNativeScriptDynamic,
// that sets up a NativeScript application and can bootstrap the Angular framework.
